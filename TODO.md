1. Rewrite the README so that I can introduce:
    The curse of memory phenomenon
    Why it's an important question?
    How to solve it with stable reparameterization? 
2. Prepare the codebase into a package so that people can call it:
    Given a model m, call the memoryfunction(m) return the memory patten as a function: R -> R.
