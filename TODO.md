1. tanh softplusrnn pol, requires more repeat on perturbation evaluation. 
2. The group of rnn is not very clear in terms of qualitative behavior. 
    (linear / hardtanh / tanh) * rnn * pol, hardtanh rnn pol needs more repeat on perturbation evaluation
3. tanh diagonalrnn pol, can be associated with some dot marks, clear appearance of curse of memory
4. linear softplusrnn pol, is not clear curse of memory 
5.
